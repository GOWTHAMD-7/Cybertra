# URL Sandbox API - Recent Changes

## Added AI-Powered Verdict Synthesis

Added integration with Google's Gemini API to provide human-readable security verdicts. This new feature synthesizes all the technical data into a clear, actionable assessment that non-technical users can understand.

### Key Features Added:

1. **AI Synthesizer Module**
   - File: `ai_synthesizer.py`
   - Template: `ai_synthesizer_prompt.txt`
   - Purpose: Creates prompts for Gemini AI and processes responses

2. **Carefully Crafted Prompt Template**:
   - Gives the AI a cybersecurity analyst persona
   - Provides clear instructions on verdict categories (Safe, Caution, Dangerous)
   - Includes guidance on weighing different security factors
   - Requests simple explanations targeted at non-technical users

3. **Integration with URL Analysis**:
   - Optional feature that can be enabled via environment variable
   - Adds AI analysis without disrupting existing functionality
   - Gracefully handles scenarios where AI synthesis fails

4. **Enhanced User Interface**:
   - Added dedicated AI analysis section to the results page
   - Visually distinct styling for AI verdicts
   - Presents explanations in user-friendly language

## Added URL Heuristic Analysis

Added a new layer of security analysis that examines the URL structure for common phishing and malicious patterns, without relying on external APIs. This provides faster initial assessment and can detect newly created phishing sites before they're reported to security databases.

### Key Features Added:

1. **URL Pattern Analysis Function**
   - Function: `analyze_url_heuristics()`
   - Location: Added to `main.py`
   - Purpose: Analyzes URL strings for common phishing tricks and suspicious patterns

2. **Detection Capabilities**:
   - Keyword stuffing (sensitive terms like "login", "secure", "account", etc.)
   - Suspicious TLDs (.xyz, .top, .info, etc.)
   - Excessive subdomains
   - Unusually long domain names
   - Character substitution tricks (0 for o, 1 for l, etc.)
   - IP addresses used instead of domain names
   - URL shorteners
   - Excessive URL encoding

3. **Integration with Existing Pipeline**:
   - Added heuristic analysis as the first step in URL checking
   - Updated all response formats to include heuristic flags
   - Enhanced verdict determination to consider heuristic analysis results
   - Modified service attribution to mention heuristic analysis

4. **Frontend Enhancements**:
   - Updated web interface to display heuristic flags when present
   - Added visual lists of suspicious patterns found in URLs

### Benefits:

1. **Reduced API Dependence**: Provides meaningful analysis even when API keys are missing
2. **Faster Initial Assessment**: Pattern analysis is performed locally before API calls
3. **Multi-layered Security**: Combines pattern analysis with Google Safe Browsing and VirusTotal
4. **Educational Value**: Helps users understand what makes a URL suspicious

### Usage:

The heuristic analysis is automatically performed for all URL checks and requires no additional configuration. Results appear in the API response and in the web interface.
